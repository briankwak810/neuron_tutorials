## NEURON/NetPyNE tutorial
Following tutorial links for [NEURON](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.4/index.html), [NetPyNE](http://doc.netpyne.org/tutorial.html) with officially released documents.

## Diesmann et al.(1999) reproduction
Reproducing 'Stable propagation of synchronous spiking in cortical neural networks' by Diesmann et al., figures explaining the stable propagation of spike pulse-packets.

Shows accumulating and dissolving neuron signal packets with attractors and saddle points in neuron space.

Experiment was done with w=100 neurons with 10 cortical layers with HH modeled neurons.
